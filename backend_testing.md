# Backend Testing

## API Testing
- start testing before the front end is ready and fix logic related bugs much cheaper
- discover bugs that can damage other products if your API is public
- increase test coverage and accuracy
- run regression tests to ensure that the recent changes didn't break your APIs and the systems using them
- check request, response, status code, and which http method was required
- **FEATURES IN API TEST**
    * API URL with the HTTP Method
    * payload (defines the structure that is supplied to the API- body)
    * request sample data (can have many test cases based on the sample data)
    * expect result (response code such as 200 OK)
    * response result messge (INVALID_PASSWORD)
    * response result sample (output data for successful call)
