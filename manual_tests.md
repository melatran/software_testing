# Manual Test Cases
- automation testing is not sufficent for many cases and that's where manual testing comes along
- manual testing is the process that is done without the use of automation tools as all tes cases are executed according to the user perspective by QA tester
- it's utilized to ensure that the application is working according to the requirements mentioned in the document
- **defects** are the different in expected vs actual result
- the defect is fixed and sent over to the tester for testing against and after the agile process is complete, the user gets a bug free software
