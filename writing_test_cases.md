# All About Writing Test Cases
- a set of actions executed to verify a particular feature or functionality of your software application
- contains test steps, test data, precondition, postcondition developed for specific test scenario to verify any requirement
- includes specific variables or conditions
- a testing engineer can compare expected and actual results to determine whether a software product is functioning as per the requirements of the customer
- documentation is important (simple but detailed)
- manual testing is usually done in a word document or spreadsheet (this is different than testing using jest or Rspec)

# Writing a Test Case
**Pre-conditions:** any assumptions that are being made or something has to happen before the event such as user can see account meaning user has be registered already

**Post-conditions:** anything that applies after the test case completes such as time and date of login stored in the database
