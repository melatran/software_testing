## Testing in Agile Projects
- testing is an activity that is done throughout the sprint not after a feature is complete
- move away from finding bugs to prevent bugs
    * know about the user
    * ask questions at the start of the product journey
- test with the mindset to find new ideas to find edge cases and hidden assumptions
- move away from breaking the system to wanting to build the best system (importance of team collaboration)
- move away that testers are responsible for quality to the whole team takes responsibility for quality of the system

## QA Methodologies
**QA (Quality Assurance):** optimize the development and testing process, select appraoches to minimize number of errors
- QA focuses on definining the requirements, set up deliverables, and automate process
- Testing looks for bugs

1. **Waterfall**
   * project broken down by stages and team moves to next phase when phase is finalized
   * QA describes the ideal version of product
   * prioritze code quality
   * oversea architect issues
   * test and checks if features were done on time
   * analyze feedback upon release
   
2. **Agile**
   * user driven approach
   * document and communicate during the process
   * values automation even if it takes time
   * metrics
   * continuous improvement meaning iterations are brought to end users

3. **Iterative Testing**
   * team checks features one by one
   * frequent updates
   * once it's done, you don't come back to it but features are deployed in smaller batches

4. **Extreme Programming**
   * focused on quality and efficiency
   * get it to working mode
   * all code must have unit tests
   * early and frequent testing
   * all code is tested
   * team sets refactoring goals

- fixing is a priority
- early automation is important
- dedicated security team
- assign responsibilities for performance quality (speed)
- short feedback loops
