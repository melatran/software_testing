## Testing in Agile Projects
- testing is an activity that is done throughout the sprint not after a feature is complete
- move away from finding bugs to prevent bugs
    * know about the user
    * ask questions at the start of the product journey
- test with the mindset to find new ideas to find edge cases and hidden assumptions
- move away from breaking the system to wanting to build the best system (importance of team collaboration)
- move away that testers are responsible for quality to the whole team takes responsibility for quality of the system
